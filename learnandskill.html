                    <h3>**Infosys Interview Experience for DSE 2022**</h3>
                    <p>I got Digital Specialist Engineer(DSE) at Infosys through Off-Campus Recruitment Drive. First-round was a coding round followed by a technical interview. 

                        Online coding round: There were three questions. One easy(Based on hashmap), one medium(based on DP), and one hard(Based on DP). I was able to solve one question 100%, one 14%, and one 10%.In the coding round, I would like to give you a suggestion that it might happen that initially, you couldn’t crack the logic but you should not quit and give your effort till the last moment.
                        
                        After almost one month my Interview was scheduled for 8 March 2022.
                        
                        Technical Interview: The interviewer asked me the following questions:
                        
                        Introduce yourself.
                        Rate yourself out of 10 in Java
                        Then he asked some core java questions
                        what is copied, constructor? (answered)
                        what is Clone()  in java? (answered)
                        What is a package? (answered)

                        Can we override the main method? (answered)
                        then he asked me two basic coding questions.
                        
                        Remove all duplicate elements from a string? (He told me to only tell logic. I told logic using Hash set and he agreed.)
                              2. Find the occurrence of all elements in a string? (I told him the logic using Hash Map.)
                        Then he asked me basic questions related to the Internship as I had mentioned in the introduction part.

                        I answered a little bit about all three questions as I was not knowing the concepts deeply. After one month on 12 April 2022, I received congratulation mail that I got selected for the DSE role.</p>
                        <h3>**TCS Interview Experience**</h3>
                        <p>Hi! I have been selected for TCS from our campus placements. Here is how I prepared and how the recruitment process took place.

                            Where did I prepare from?
                            
                            I was trained by FACE in my college. They have provided me with materials for TCS preparation. About 90% of the questions were repeated from their materials. I have also prepared from their site faceprep.in and other sites like m4maths.com. These are the best sites for TCS preparation.
                            
                            TCS conducted 3 rounds in our college
                            
                            Online test Round
                            Technical Round + Managerial Round
                            HR Round
                            Online test: The online test had 5 sections. Aptitude, verbal, logical, email writing, and C MCQ questions. Email writing was easy. There were hints given and we need to use each of these and write an email. C MCQ questions were very simple and repeated from FACE materials.
                            
                            Technical Round + Managerial Round The students who cleared the online test were called for an interview. The interview was basically focused on testing skills the candidate is good at. I am from an ECE background. Since my favorite subjects were Computer networks and Digital logic design, I was asked questions about the same. I was also asked to write a few basic programs in C such as a Program to add two numbers, to check if a given number is a palindrome. Questions from Computer networks were as follows:
                            
                            About the different layers and their functioning
                            About TCP/IP protocol
                            Difference between TCP and UDP
                            About subnetting
                            HR Round: This is the final round of the recruitment process. The questions were very simple and focused to test my communication skills. A few of them were:
                            
                            Are you a team member or a team leader
                            Tell me about yourself
                            How do you handle situations when two of your teammates have quarrels.
                            Your hobbies
                            Walk me through your resume
                            The interview went smoothly as the recruiters were very patient and polite.
